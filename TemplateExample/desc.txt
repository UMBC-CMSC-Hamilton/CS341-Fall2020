I've implemented a linked list stack with template parameter T just to show how it is done and to give you an example of most of the template functionality that you might need for the project.  Templates are difficult.  

Remember, all of your code needs to go into the .h file, you have no .cpp file.  Using a .cpp file without some trickery results in linker errors and all kinds of additional horrors.
